In some languages, it’s common to use camel case (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.
