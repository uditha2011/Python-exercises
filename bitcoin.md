Bitcoin is a form of digitial currency, otherwise known as cryptocurrency. Rather than rely on a central authority like a bank, Bitcoin instead relies on a distributed network, otherwise known as a blockchain, to record transactions.

Because thereâ€™s demand for Bitcoin (i.e., users want it), users are willing to buy it, as by exchanging one currency (e.g., USD) for Bitcoin.

Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, n, that they would like to buy. If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float.
